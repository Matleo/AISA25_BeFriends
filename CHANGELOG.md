# Changelog

## [0.7.0] - 2025-11-XX
### Added
- Automatic event import from newest CSV (`befriends/data/11_events.csv`) at backend startup, ensuring up-to-date event data including SAK LÃ¶rrach and other regional events.
- Debug logging for event import, repository actions, and recommendation logic to aid troubleshooting and transparency.

- Recommendation service and chatbot logic updated to always use region from filters or user profile, ensuring correct event surfacing.
