# Changelog


## [0.5.0] - 2025-09-22
### Added
- Chatbot and recommendations now always filter events by the user's preferred city (from profile) and only show events for the current week.
- User profile city is mapped to the region filter for all event queries and recommendations.
- Date filters for recommendations panel are automatically set to this week's range (Monday-Sunday).

### Fixed
- Prevented events from other cities/regions (e.g., Freiburg) from appearing in recommendations when user preference is set.
- Ensured consistent event filtering logic between chatbot and recommendations panel.

### Changed
- Refactored `components/ui.py` and `components/chatbot_service.py` to enforce user preference and date logic for all event queries.

### Release
- This release completes the "chatbot backend logic" milestone for EventBot.
